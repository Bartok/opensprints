FW update:
* added test mode feature. A fake sensor event message is sent to the PC every 10 centiseconds. the sensor event messages alternate between bike 1 (sensor 0) and bike 2 (sensor 1). the test mode is initiated by the PC by sending the interface board the command
HW
followed by <enter> or carriage return.
stop the test mode by sending the interface board the command
ST
followed by <enter> or carriage return.

* cleaned up the code some
* fixed a bad yet hidden bug that could make bike 2 (sensor 0) have a disadvantage.
* FW version bumped to 0.32

FW update: improved the time stamp format to prevent overflow at around 6 mins. the new format for a sensor event message (tick) is as follows:

riderNumber;minutesElapsed:hundredthsSecondsElapsed

the line ends with a carriage return. FW is now at ver 0.31

next item to do: test mode which randomly or periodically sends fake ticks to the PC app.

added timestamps to each sensor event message. the format is 

bikenumber:timestamp

e.g.

1:450

2:452

the time stamp is given in hundredths of a second.

I just got it working, so the code needs to be cleaned up a bit.
