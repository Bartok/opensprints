DONE:
1. pads: hole / copper size
   * decision: using 36mil holes, 72 mil copper.

kicad too small: drill = 0.0320", copper = 0.0550"
kicad bigger: drill = 0.040", copper = 0.060" (copper is too small)
kicad tracks = 0.017"

eagle tracks, fat = 0.032", skinny = 0.016"
eagle pads, drill = 0.8mm / copper = 1.31mm,  drill = 0.9mm / copper = 1.41mm

SFE
0.020” vias are allowed. 15mil is minimum
Use 10mil traces on designs where possible. 8mil is acceptable. 7mil is minimum.
Use thicker traces for power lines where applicable. 12mil=100mA max, 16mil=500mA, and so
on.
Spacing is 8mil between traces and space.
Use a 12mil isolation setting on any ground pour. This will help prevent pours from shorting to
traces.
● 12mil Pad restrings = annular rings (?)
● 10mil Via restrings (vias tented)
● 10mil Copper/Dimension size
● 8mil trace/space


3. interface board - route traces
3.0 headers connected to the outside (and inside?)of the arduino connectors
3.1 grid of pads
4. do sensor board (eagle?)
